            <p>  </p>
            <a href="https://github.com/SaiShivani91/Car_Price_Prediction_System"><b>Car Price Prediction using Random Forest Regressor </b></a>
            <li>Developed a car price prediction web application using Random Forest Regressor and Randomized search CV.</li>
            <li>Data Collection was done from the Kaggle and API. EDA was performed and the correlation between the target variable and the predictors was found in order to perform effective feature engineering.</li>
            <li>Random forest regressor along with random search CV was used to build an efficient and accurate prediction system.</li>
            <li>Deployed the application using Heroku successfully</li>

            <p>  </p>
            <a href="https://github.com/SaiShivani91/Projects"><b>Movie Recommendation System using BERT</b></a>
            <li>Developed an advanced movie recommendation system that combines Sentence Transformers and BERT-based embeddings to improve recommendation accuracy by thoroughly understanding textual context and semantic similarity</li>
            <li>In this system, transformer-based models and embedding methodologies for advanced data analysis and recommendation systems, were employed</li>
            

            <p>   </p>
            <a href="https://github.com/SaiShivani91/stock_price_prediction"><b>Stock Price Prediction using Time Series Forecasting</b></a>
            <li>Developed a stock price prediction system for Microsoft stock data using the machine learning algorithm XGBoost</li>
            <li>Microsoft stock price data for a period of five years from 2018 to 2022 was collected from Yahoo Finance and API and EDA and data visualization was done python libraries pandas, matplotlib and seaborn</li>
            <li>Data Modelling was done using various algorithms like ARIMA, SARIMAX, Random Forest, XGBoost and LSTM. Among all these algorithms, the XGBoost model has given the best results in terms Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error</li>
